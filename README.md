## Hi there 👋

As a finance professional for over 20 years, I have built many financial models and valuation studies for capital budgeting, debt restructuring, and merger & acquisition for various industries. Building models and analyzing data have been my passion.

During lockdown due to Covid 19 pandemic in 2000, I got introduced to data science and started learning Python and R programming languages and taking data science courses.
