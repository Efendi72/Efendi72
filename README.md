# About Me ðŸ‘‹

I am a finance professional who is passionate about building models and creating technology that give access to more people.

Throughout my twenty-year professional career, I have built many financial models for capital budgeting, debt restructuring, and merger & acquisition for various industries.

During lockdown due to Covid 19 pandemic in 2000, I got introduced to data science and started learning Python and R programming languages and taking data science courses.
