## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a finance professional for over 20 years, I have built many financial models and valuation studies for capital budgeting, debt restructuring, and merger & acquisition for various industries.

During lockdown due to Covid 19 pandemic in 2000, I started learning data science. I started learning Python and R and taking data science courses.
